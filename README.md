EDMdesigner-API
===============

[EDMdesigner](http://www.edmdesigner.com) is a drag and drop tool for creating responsive HTML e-mail templates very quickly and painlessly, radically increasing your click-through rate. This documentation is to give you a detailed description about the EDMdesigner-API with which you can integrate our editor into any web-based system (e.g. a CRM, CMS, WebShop or anything else you can imagine).

To start developing with our api, please request an API_KEY (and a corresponding magic word) at info@edmdesigner.com.

Basically, the only thing you have to do is to implement one side of the handshaking on your server. When the handshaking is done, you can use the sent object, in which you can find the functions that are communicating with our server.

The handshaking is built into the initialization process, so if you implemented the handshaking on your side, everything will work automatically.

We provide example implementations that include the handshaking as well. You can find the continously broading list at the end of this page at the Example implementations section.

Initializing
------------
	
	<script src="path_to_your_jquery.js"></script>
	<script src="http://api.edmdesigner.com/EDMdesignerAPI.js?route=##handshaking_route##"></script>
	<script>
		initEDMdesignerPlugin("##userId##", function(edmDesignerApi) {
			...
		}, onErrorCB);
		
		function onErrorCB(error) {
			console.log(error);
		}
	</script>
	
First of all, jQuery has to be loaded before you load our API. In the second line you can see a route parameter in the script's src. By that you can tell the script where to look for the handshaking implementation. For example, if you implemented it in your index.php, you have to replace ##handshaking_route## with index.php. The first parameter is a user id from your system. It can be any string. The last parameter is an error callback which will be called in every request if the request fails. This is not required thus you can set an error callback in one of your function calls (see later) and in that case it will be called instead of this one.

In the resulting object (edmDesignerApi) you will find some functions through which you can interact with our system.

### Handshaking
To implement the handshaking on your server, you need an API_KEY, a magic word (wich is delivered with your API_KEY), your user's IPv4 address and a timestamp. The logic that handles handshaking has to receive the userId too, because it has to be sent to our server as well. Our API implementation automatically sends the userId in a POST HTTP request. You can set this user id by the first parameter of the initEDMdesignerPlugin.

After concatenating the API_KEY, the IPv4 address of your user, the timestamp (as a string) and your magic word, you have to create an md5 hash of the resulting string.

	
	hash = md5(API_KEY + ipv4 + timestamp + magic)


After this, you have to send the API_KEY, the userId, the IPv4 address, the timestamp and the generated md5 hash to our server at api.edmdesigner.com/api/token through HTTP.

If everything goes well, you get back a token, with which your user can be identified.

# Server side routes
Almost every client side functions have a corresponding route on server side.


## Admin routes

##Authentication
To authenticate these routes, you need to generate a token to a "fake" user called admin.You should send this token and the admin string on every request's query. (like this: ?user=admint&token=token ).Please note that every route need to be authenticated expect the one which generate the token. (//api.edmdesigner.com/api/token)

Example: //api.edmdesigner.com/json/groups/list?user=admin&token=adminToken

### Create handshaking
Create the handshaking between PHP and API needs to be done before any further call
		
		$url = "http://api.edmdesigner.com/api/token";
		$data = array(
			"id"	=> $publicId,
			"uid"	=> $user,
			"ip"	=> $ip,
			"ts"	=> $timestamp,
			"hash"	=> $hash
		);

##Gallery handling
If you want to host the uploaded images yourself and want to use your other hosted images as well, then there are a few routes to fulfil this functionality.

Basic operation: The user uploads an image in the api to our server, which uploads it to the given server. This requires you to implement an upload route on your server and [configure](#configure-api-servers-gallery) our server (you have to do the configuration only once). The user can delete the images as well, so there should be an delete route on your server (it should be in the [gallery configuration](#configure-api-servers-gallery)) .

___

### Upload route
You should implement a route on your server which we can use for image upload.

Type: POST

We will upload the images as the following. There will be a "userId" field in the query of the request, it will contain the id of the user (who wants to upload the image). The image will be uplaoded as a file (the field name will be "file") and there will be another field "userId", it will contain the same data as the query field "userId". There is a third field, called "originalFileName" which contains the name of the original file before the user started to upload it.

The response to our post request should be an image object. The object should have the following properties:
  * url {String} /REQUIRED/ The url where the newly uploaded image can be found.
  * secure_url {String} Http secure version og the image url
  * thumb_url {String} An url where the thumbnail version of the image is available (Tha gallery can work a lot faster if you can provide a thumbnail)
  * name {String} The name of the image. If it is not given then we will you the last segment of the url
  * width {Number} The original width of the image (It can save a lot of process if you can provide this information)
  * height {Number} The original height of the image (It can save a lot of process if you can provide this information)

___

### Delete route
You should implement a route on your server side which we can use for deleting images.

Type: POST

We will post an object with two parameters:
  * url {String} The url of the deleted image
  * userId {String} The id of the user who deleted the image.

Your response to our post request should be 200. (HTTP status code) 

___

### Copy route
IF you want to copy a project from a user to an other and want to copy the images (which are used in the project) too, you need to use the [create from to with images route](#creat-from-to-with-images). This route will collect the urls of the images (which you host) of the project and send it to you. After that you should make a copy of this images to the target user and sent us back the parameters of this new images.

Type: POST  

We will post an object whit only one parameter:
  * urls {Array} It contains the urls of the images which are used in the template
  * from_userId {String} The id of the user from who we want to copy a template to the target user
  * target_userId {String} The id of the user who will get the new template. (You need to 'copy' the given images to this user)

Your response to our post request should be an object. This object the following "key - value" pairs: the old url (which you get from the urls array we sent with the post request). should be the key and the value should be the parameters of the new image (like the one you need to send beack in the [upload route](#upload-route):
  * url {String} /REQUIRED/ The url where the newly uploaded image can be found.
  * secure_url {String} Http secure version og the image url
  * thumb_url {String} An url where the thumbnail version of the image is available (Tha gallery can work a lot faster if you can provide a thumbnail)
  * name {String} The name of the image. If it is not given then we will you the last segment of the url
  * width {Number} The original width of the image (It can save a lot of process if you can provide this information)
  * height {Number} The original height of the image (It can save a lot of process if you can provide this information)

For example: 
If we uploaded the following array: ["www.foo.bar", "http://test.com/image.jpg"] then your asnwer should be something like this object:
	
	var answer = {
		"www.foo.bar": {
			url: "www.copy.of.foo.bar"
		},
		"http://test.com/image.jpg": {
			url: "http://test.com/copyimage.jpg",
			secure_url: "https://test.com/copyimage.jpg",
			thumb_url: "http://test.com/thumb/copyimage.jpg",
			name: "copyimage.jpg",
			width: 600,
			height: 200
		}

##Headers & footers
You can upload headers and footers which your users will be able to use. A header will appear on the top of their templates and the footer will appear on the bottom.
The users won’t be able to edit these two elements or remove them.  
If you upload any header and/or footer, then the affected users have to use one. If you want to have a group of users who don’t have to use any kind of header and/or footer, then do not upload header and/or footer to all of your users ([general upload](#upload-header-2)) or upload the group an empty header and/or footer. This way they can choose the empty one and then there will be no header and/or footer on their templates.  
You can upload different kind of headers and/or footers. If you do so, then the affected users will be able to choose which header they want to use, but they still have to use one of them.   
The newly created document will get a header and/or footer if the user (who created the project) has any header and/or footer. A user can have header and/or footer if it was uploaded directly to him or to his group or if there are headers and/or footers which were uploaded to every users. (The header and/or footer priority is the following: user’s personal headers and/or footers <  user’s group’s headers and/or footers < general headers and/or footers)

There is three different ways to upload headers. You can upload it:
  - to all your user ([general header upload](#upload-headers-2)) 
  - to a specified group ([upload headers to group](#upload-headers)) 
  - to specified user or users ([upload headers to user](#upload-headers-1))

Footers can be uploaded in the same ways:
  - to everyone ([general footer upload](#upload-footers-2))
  - to a specified group ([upload footers to a group](#upload-footers))
  - to specified user or users ([upload footers to users](#upload-footers-1))


### Structure
The representing object fore header or footer should have the following properties:
  - document {Object} /REQUIRED/ it should be a json object ([which represent our templates](#json-document-descriptors))
    - root /REQUIRED/ There should be the structure of the header or footer. __It must be a ["FULLWIDTH_CONTAINER"](#full-width-container) type!__
    - generalSettings
  - id {String} /REQUIRED/ this id is what we use for distinguish the headers from each other so __it should be unique!__ Please note that the id you want to use for the users headers should be different from the ids of the general headers or the ids of the user's group's headers. The same is true for the footers.
  - title {Object} it should contains language code - title string pairs. For example: 'en': 'Green-white header'. The title will appear on the dropdown list. If you don't want to use any other localization then please use the 'en' language code, the default will always be the 'en' regardless of the actual language!  
  - placeholders {Object} it is needed when you want to have more than one supported language on your headers or footers. If you want to know how do the placeholders work please read the [localization](#localization) part of the [headers & footers](#headers--footers) chapter.

Example:
	
	var headerOrFooter = {
		"document":  {
			"root": {
				"leftChildren" : [
					{
						"text" : "<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">##title##</h1>",
						"type" : "TITLE"
					}
					{
						"text" : "<p style=\"text-align: right;\">##example-palceholder##</p>",
						"defaultText" : "Double click to edit",
						"type" : "TEXT"
					}
				],
				"rightChildren": [],
				"rightBackgroundColor" : "",
				"leftBackgroundColor" : "",
				"twoCell" : "false",
				"order" : "LTR",
				"type" : "FULLWIDTH_CONTAINER"
			}
		},
		"id": "My-example-header-or-footer-unique-id",
		"title": {
			"en": "example title",
		 	"hu": "példa cím"
		},
		"placeholders": { 
				'##title##': {
					'en': 'The header is a good thing',
					'hu': 'A fejléc egy jó dolog',
				},
	 			'##example-palceholder##: {
	 				'en': 'It is an example',
	 				'hu': 'Ez egy példa',
	 			}
		}
	};
___

### Localization
It is possible to use different localization with the same headers and/or footers but __not required__.  
If you want to support only one language then you should "hardcode" the content of the header or footer to the representing json and it should work perfectly. In that case you do not have to use the placeholders object (see [stucture](#structure)).  
If you want to support more than one language, then you have to use the placeholders object. You should not write the actual content to the json instead you should use a placeholder (for example if you have a title element in your header or footer, then the text of the title should be the placeholder instead of the actual content. We will replace the placeholders in our application). You can give any kind of name to this placeholder, but it should begin and end with two '#' character (for example: ##title##.). After that you have to insert the placeholder to the placeholders object as follows: the key should be the name of the placeholder, and the value should be an object conatining the language code - value pairs of the actual content.  
Example placeholders object: 

	placeholders: { '##title##': {
				'en': 'The header is a good thing',
				'hu': 'A fejléc egy jó dolog',
				//...
			},
	 		'##example-palceholder##: {
	 			'en': 'It is an example',
	 			'hu': 'Ez egy példa',
	 			//...
	 			}
	 }
	 
You can localize the name (title) of the headers and/or footers too. The title of a header or footer is the text which will appear on the dropdown list, where the user will be able to choose from them.  
If you want to support more than one language you just have to put the language code - text pair to the title object (see [structure](#structure)).
An example title object: 

	title: { 'en': 'example title',
		 'hu': 'példa cím'
		 /...
		}
		
If you support a language but you do not want to give the header or footer a different title in the other language, you do not have to, but please note that this way the default title will be used on the dropdown list for this header, and the default is always the 'en' (english) version of the title.  

Example:  
_We support the english and the hungarian languages. We upload two headers with the following two title objects: title: {'en': 'first 	header'} and title: {'en': 'second header', 'hu': 'Második fejléc'}. If someone select the hungarian language, then in his dropdown 		list there will be two selectable header: 'first header' and 'Második fejléc', but if someone choose the english version, then 		the dropdown list will look like the following: 'first header' and 'second header'._  

If you do not give an 'en' (english) title to a header, then it will be generated automatically in our application, so it is suggested to always upload an 'en' version of the title too.

##complexElements
The complex elem is a possible tool to save a BOX or MULITCOLL element with all of it contents to be able to reuse it. This feature is created for make the template editing more fast so more effective.
A complex elem can binded to a user, to a group of users or to all of the users.
When a user uses the editor these binding displays all together and can be used all of them.

The administrator of the application can upload complex elems to all of the above possibilities.
The user of the editor can save complex elems only for him/herself, those will be added to the admin defined items.
The editor users can also delete those complex elems what are binded to him/herself as a user.

These are the 3 ways to upload complex elems as an admin:

### Structure
The representing object for a Complex elem should have the following properties:  
  - doc {Object} /REQUIRED/ it should be a json object (which represent our templates)
    - type /REQUIRED/ It must be ["BOX"](#box), ["MULTICOLUMN"](#multicolumn) or ["FULLWIDTH_CONTAINER"](#full-width-container)
    - generalSettings
  - id {String} /optional/ this id is what will identify the item for you if you would like to manage it via admin
  - title {Object} /optional/ it should contains language code - title string pairs. For example: 'en': 'Green-white complexElem'. If you miss to give it, we it will receive a default name. The title will appear on the list of the complex element. If you don't want to use any other localization then please use the 'en' language code, the default will always be the 'en' regardless of the actual language!  


___


### Localization
It is possible to use different localization with the same complex elem but __not required__.
You can localize the title of the complex elem. The title of a complex elem will appear on the list, where the user will be able to choose from.  
If you want to support more than one language you just have to put the language code - text pair to the title object (see [structure](#structure)).
An example title object: 

	title: { 'en': 'example title',
		 'hu': 'példa cím'
		 /...
		}

## Dynamic Elements
This element is good for those who want their users to be able to change their emails/templates content easily. Users can add a dynamic element to their templates and choose which type of content will it display ([structure](#dynamic-element-structure), how will it look like ([template](#dynamic-element-template) and what the actual content will be ([data](#dynamic-element-data)).  
You can upload any number of different dynamic element type ([structure](#dynamic-element-structure), and create any number of different looks ([template](#dynamic-element-template) for your structures and assign any number of content ([data](#dynamic-element-data)) to those too.
You can even choose which type of dynamic elements can your user use, or users belonging to a specified group. You even can set which templates can someone use or not. There is even an option for making a dynamic element type/template to be available for all of your users.
Please note that the data can only be added to groups or specified users.

### Dynamic element structure
The structure is the main part of the dynamic element. It specifies the type of the dynamic element. For example, it can be a "Product" (which means that the dynamic element will be able to display products), or a "company" or whatever you want. It is the connection between [data](#dynamic-element-data) and [templates](#dynamic-element-template). It describe how the data's structure should look like (which kind of placeholders should it use, etc) and which placeholders should a template contains. It also contains a default content for the dynamic elements. When a user choose a structure , then the default content will appear and the user can change it with selecting one of his data.  
The structure is very important , because every templates and data have to be assign to one of your structures!

You can assign structures to:  
  - all of your users ([add to apiPartner](#add-structures-to-everyone))
  - a specified group ([add to group](#add-structures-to-group))
  - a specified user or users ([add to user](#add-structures-to-users))

A structure object should have the following properties:
  - id {String} This id is very __important__. You have to use it everywhere, so choose carefully! It should be unique!
  - label {Object} It should contain "language code - title" pairs. It works like the headers and footers title property (you can read about it [here](#localization)). Please note that the 'en' language code will be the default label! If you do not give any 'en' version, then we will generate one.
  - placeHolders {Object} It should contain "placeholder - default value" pairs. A placeholderder can be any kind of string with two '#' character at the beginning and the end of it. (example: "##correctPlaceHolder##"). It works almost similar like the headers and footers placeholders (expect , here you do not have to use localization). You can read more about the header and footer placeholders [here](#localization).

Example:
	
	var structure = {
		id: "my-structure-id",
		label: {
			'en': 'Product',
			'hu': 'Termék'
		},
		placeHolders: {
			'##title##': 'default title',
			'##image-src##': 'http://default.image.src',
			'##description##': 'default foo bar description',
			'##price##': '0'
		},
	};


### Dynamic element template
The template is responsible for the visual appearance of a dynamic element. A template always has to be assigned to a [structure](#dynamic-element-structure) and it has to contain the placeholders which the structure define. It is important because when the user choose a [data](#dynamic-element-data) for the dynamic element, then the placeholders will be replaced with actual content.
You can assign any number of templates to a structure.  

You can create templates to:
  - all of your users ([add to apiPartner](#add-templates-to-everyone))
  - a specified group ([add to group](#add-templates-to-group))
  - a specified user or users ([add to user](#add-templates-to-users))

A template object should have the following properties:
  - id {String} If you do not give any id then we will generate one.
  - label {Object} It should contain "language code - title" pairs. It works like the headers and footers title property (you can read about it [here](#localization)). Please note that the 'en' language code will be the default label! If you do not give any 'en' version, then we will generate one.
  - doc {Object} Json document ([see more](#json-document-descriptors)). It must be ["BOX"](#box) or ["MULTICOLUMN"](#multicolumn)! (of course, it can have any number of children). Please note that it cannot contain any or be a ["FULLWIDTH_CONTAINER"](#full-width-container)!
  - structureId {String} The id of the structure which the template belongs to.

Example: 

	var template = {
		id: 'my-template-id',
		label: {
			'en': 'Simple Template',
			'hu': 'Sima Sablon'
		},
		doc: {
	            "children" : [ 
	                {
	                    "text" : "<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">##title##</h1>",
	                    "type" : "TITLE"
	                }, 
	                {
	                    "originalHeight" : "0",
	                    "originalWidth" : "0",
	                    "sizeType" : "FIXED",
	                    "link" : "",
	                    "altText" : "",
	                    "src" : "##image-src##",
	                    "id" : "",
	                    "align" : "center",
	                    "type" : "IMAGE"
	                }, 
	                {
	                    "text" : "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">##description##</p>",
	                    "type" : "TEXT"
	                }, 
	                {
	                    "text" : "<p style=\"text-align: right;\">price: ##price##</p>",
	                    "type" : "TEXT"
	                }
	            ],
	            "type" : "BOX"
    		},
    		structureId: "my-structure-id"
	};

### Dynamic element data
The data contains the actual content of the dynamic element. A template always has to be assigned to a [structure](#dynamic-element-structure) and it has to contain "placholder - value " (example: "##placeholder##": "value") for every placeholders the structure contains.  
You can assign any number of data to a structure.  

You can add data to:
  - a specified group ([add to group](#add-data-to-group))
  - a specified user or users ([add to user](#add-data-to-users))

A Data object should have the following properties: 
  - id {String} If you do not give any id then we will generate one.
  - label {Object} /REQUIRED/ It should contain "language code - title" pairs. It works like the headers and footers title property (you can read about it [here](#localization)). Please note that the 'en' language code will be the default label! If you do not give any 'en' version then we will generate one.
  - palceHolders {Object} /REQUIRED/ It should contain "placeholder - default value" pairs. A placeholderder can be any kind of string with two '#' character at the beginning and the end of it. (example: "##correctPlaceHolder##"). It works almost similar like the headers and footers placeholders (expect , here you do not have to use localization). You can read more about the header and footer placeholders [here](#localization).
  - structureId {String} /REQUIRED/ The id of the structure which the data belongs to.

Example:

	var data = {
		id: 'my-data-id',
		label: {
			'en': 'EDM beer'
		},
		placeHolders: {
			'##title##': 'EDM beer',
			'##image-src##': 'http://www.beer100.com/images/beermug.jpg',
			'##description##': 'Best beer ever! You should try it!',
			'##price##': '10$'
		},
		structureId: 'my-structure-id'
	};

Feature Switch
---------------
You can allow or forbid some features of our application to a group of your users.
The list of the features you can set at the moment:  
  - gallery {Object}: contains the features of the gallery
    - noUpload {Boolean} If you set this parameter true then the users belong to this group cannot use the upload functionality. If you configured the gallery noUploadText (see [gallery config](#configure-api-servers-gallery)) text then it will appear on the upload tab, otherwise a default text will be used.
    - noUrl {Bollean} If you set this parameter true, then the users of this group cannot use any image not hosted by you. The image from url tab of the gallery will disappear if the feature does not allowed.
    - limit {Number} The number of images the user can upload. If you do not want to set any limit then leave this parameter undefined. If a user reach the limit, then he won't be able to upload any more image and if you configured the gallery limitReached (see [gallery config](#configure-api-servers-gallery)) text then it will be displayed otherwise a default text will be used.  Please note that the 0 limit and the noUpload are almost equivalent except a different message will appear on the upload tab if you use one or the other.

This list is constantly expanding with time!

---

JSON document descriptors
-------------------------
In some cases you - as an integrator - migth want to use the raw document format instead of using the editor and fetch the document from the created project. Some example cases could be when you want to set custom headers and footers to some of your users or you want to create complex or dynamic element.

We can distiguish two main element descriptors, from which a whole document can be composed. These two main types are the containers and the leaf elements.

Every element has its type property. The possible values are the followings: "BOX", "MULTICOLUMN", "ROOT", "TEXT", "TITLE", "IMAGE", "BUTTON and "FULLWIDTH_CONTAINER".

##Containers
Containers are used to group some elements and define the layout of the project. You can put any kind of elements into containers, so these elements can be other containers and leaf elements as well.
###Box
Boxes are great to hold other elements together, give them margins, paddings, borders and/or background.
Example:

	{
		type: "BOX",
		margin: {
			top: 0,
			right: 20,
			bottom: 0,
			left: 20
		},
		padding: {
			top: 10,
			right: 10,
			bottom: 10,
			left: 10
		},
		border: {
			top: {
				style: "solid",
				width: 1,
				color: "#aabbaa"
			},
			right: {
				style: "dotted",
				width: 2,
				color: "#aabbaa"
			},
			bottom: {
				style: "dashed",
				width: 3,
				color: "#aabbaa"
			},
			left: {
				style: "none",
				width: 0,
				color: "#aabbaa"
			}
		},
		background: {
			color: "#00aaff",
			image: {
				src: "http://startups.hu/images/logos/edmdesigner.png",
				repeat: "no-repeat",
				position: "top center"
			}
		},
		children: [
			//puth the child elements here
		]
	}
	
The properties what you can see in the example above, are optional.

###Multicolumn
Multicolumns are the main elements to create complex layouts. They can have multiple columns (we support max. 5 in our editor) and every columns can have children. Example:

	{
		type: "MULTICOLUMN",
		cols: [
			[
				//children of the first column
			],
			[
				//children of the second column
			]
		]
	}

###Root
Every document starts with this elem, as this is the top parent elem. It contains a full width container as a child what has a box inside as a child. It has no other property out of the children field. ({type: "ROOT", ... }) In the near future - when we will introduce the full width containers - it will change a little bit.  

Example:

	{
		type: "ROOT",
		children: [
			{
				type: "FULLWIDTH_CONTAINER,
				leftChildren: [
					type: "BOX",
					... any box properties ...
				],
				order: "LTR",
				twoCell: false
			}
		]
	}

###Full width container
The main feature of this element type will be that the background color can be full width, not only 600px as the root element.
It can only be a direct child of the root, so can be placed only in the highest level of the document structure. A fullwidth container can have 1 cell, or one left cell and one right cells divided from the middle. The cells can have their own background color. The elem can be set "left to right" or "right to left". In case of "left to right" setting the left cells will be ordered on the top if there is no enough room for both in the same line. In case of "right to left" the right cell will do so. If the element is set to be 1 celled, the order property determines that which cell is displayed. The content of the not visible cell always will be stored so will never be lost only not displayed.    

Example:

	{
		type: "FULLWIDTH_CONTAINER",
		order: "RTL", (or "LTR")
		twoCell: "true", (or "false")
		leftBackgroundColor: "#aaaaaa",
		rightBackgroundColor: "#FF0000",
		leftChildren: [
			...any element except root and fullwidth container...
		],
		rightChildren: [
			...any element except root and fullwidth container...
		]
	}

##Leaf elements
Leaf elements cannot have any child elements. These elements are typically the content elements.

###Text
The text element must contain 2 fields: 'text' what can contain html code, but you should not put very complex things in i, and the 'type' with constant 'TEXT'. 
In our editor we enable the simple text formatting options (bold, italic, underlined) and lists (ul, ol) and some other very simple things like h1, h2, h3.
The 'linkColor' and 'linkUnderLine' specifies the links styles for those <a> tags what has no inline style. The defaults values can be found in the example below. 
The 'textStyles' specifies the style for those (non H1, H2, H3) text contents what have no inline specified style. The defaults values can be found in the example below. 
The 'h1Styles', 'h2Styles' and 'h3Styles' specifies the style for those (H1, H2, H3) tags what have no inline specified style. The defaults values can be found in the example below. 
The spacing specifies a padding values around the whole text div. The defaults values can be found in the example below. 

 Example:

	{
		text: "yo <i>this</i> is Sparta",
		type: "TEXT",
		linkColor: "#5555ff",
	        linkUnderLine: true,
	        textStyles: {
	            lineHeight: 14,
	            color": "#000000",
	            size": 14,
	            family": "arial"
	        },
	         h3Styles: {
	            lineHeight: 32,
	            color": "#000000",
	            size": 32,
	            family": "arial"
	        },
	         h2Styles: {
	            lineHeight: 26,
	            color": "#000000",
	            size": 26,
	            family": "arial"
	        },
	         h1Styles: {
	            lineHeight: 20,
	            color": "#000000",
	            size": 20,
	            family": "arial"
	        },
		"spacing": {
                    "left": "5",
                    "bottom": "5",
                    "right": "5",
                    "top": "5"
                }
	}

###Title
Title elements are just like texts, but we enable the users to set only h1, h2 and h3 as formatting.

Example:

	{
		text: "yo <i>this</i> is Sparta",
		type: "TITLE",
		linkColor: "#5555ff",
	        linkUnderLine: true,
	         h3Styles: {
	            lineHeight: 32,
	            color": "#000000",
	            size": 32,
	            family": "arial"
	        },
	         h2Styles: {
	            lineHeight: 26,
	            color": "#000000",
	            size": 26,
	            family": "arial"
	        },
	         h1Styles: {
	            lineHeight: 20,
	            color": "#000000",
	            size": 20,
	            family": "arial"
	        },
		"spacing": {
                    "left": "5",
                    "bottom": "5",
                    "right": "5",
                    "top": "5"
                }
	}

###Image
Images are relatively complex elements. Just like boxes, they can have paddings, margins, borders, background color (no background image), but they can't have children. They have their own, special properties as well:
  - src: the url of the image
  - altText: the alt text
  - link: you can wrapp in a link to your image with this propery
  - originalWidth: the original width of the image
  - originalHeight: the original height of the image
  - width: the scaled width of the image (how width should it be in your newsletter)
  - height: the scaled height of the image (how heigh should it be in your newsletter) - this is a must have property if you want your newsletters to render nice on outlooks

###Button
Button is relatively complex as well. It can have the following box properties: paddings, margins, borders, backgrouns (color and background image as well). In addition it can have radius. Baically button is a fancy link, so it has the following properties as well:
  - text: the text what sould appear (it can be a simple html snippet as well)
  - href: the link.
  - sizeType: "FIXED" - exact amount of pixels, "FIT_TO_TEXT": the width will be based on the width of the text
  - width: num of pixels if the sizeType is "FIXED"
